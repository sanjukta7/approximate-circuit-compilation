        """Construct the symbolic circuit.

        There are two ways to construct:
            - Provide the number of units and configs to construct symbolic layers from the RG;
            - Provide directly the symbolic layers (must be correctly ordered).

        However in both cases the caller must provide:
            - The RG, which provides the basic properties;
            - The number of channels and classes, which specify the sizes of the input and output.

        If both configs for sum and product specify SumProductLayer as the layer class, they must \
        be the same, which will be used for layer fusion. Otherwise, both should not be \
        SumProductLayer. If directly prodiving layers, the use of SumProductLayer must observe the \
        same rule. This requirement is not checked in symbolic circuit but in TensorizedCircuit.

        Args:
            region_graph (RegionGraph): The underlying region graph.
            num_channels (int, optional): The number of channels of the circuit input, i.e., the \
                number of units for the variables. Defaults to 1.
            num_input_units (Optional[int], optional): The number of units in the input layer. \
                Defaults to None.
            num_sum_units (Optional[int], optional): The number of units in the sum layer. \
                Defaults to None.
            num_classes (int, optional): The number of classes of the circuit output, i.e., the \
                number of units in the output layer. Defaults to 1.
            input_cfg (Optional[SymbCfgFactory[InputLayer]], optional): The config factory for \
                input layers. Defaults to None.
            sum_cfg (Optional[SymbCfgFactory[SumLayer]], optional): The config factory for sum \
                layers. Defaults to None.
            prod_cfg (Optional[SymbCfgFactory[ProductLayer]], optional): The config factory for \
                product layers. Defaults to None.
            layers (Optional[Iterable[SymbolicLayer]], optional): The layers of the circuit, will \
                override all above for layers if provided. Must be ordered in the same way as \
                RGNode but this is not checked. Defaults to None.
